The Battle of the Neighborhoods
=====================
In this project, i am creating a hypothetical scenario. My client, a successful restaurant chain in Brazil is looking to expand in New York. 
They want to create a Brazilian steakhouse restaurant. However, he does not know in which neighborhood the restaurant would gain the most attention
from customers and face the least competition from other steakhouses.
